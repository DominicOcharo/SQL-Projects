# SQL Data Projects Repository

This repository contains two SQL projects: Covid-19 Analysis Using SQL and SQL Data Cleaning Project- Nashville Housing data. Each project deals with different datasets and performs specific analyses or data cleaning tasks. Below are the details of each project:

## 1. Covid-19 Analysis Using SQL
This project involves analyzing Covid-19 data using SQL queries. Various aspects of the pandemic are explored, including total cases vs total deaths percentage, total cases vs population, countries with the highest infection rate, countries with the highest death count per population, and global statistics. The dataset includes information about Covid-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population for different countries and continents.

## 2. SQL Data Cleaning Project- Nashville Housing Data
In this project, SQL queries are used to clean and preprocess Nashville housing data. The cleaning tasks involve standardizing the SaleDate column, populating property address data, breaking down property addresses into separate columns for address, city, and state, splitting owner addresses, changing 'Y' and 'N' values in the SoldAsVacant column to 'Yes' and 'No', and removing duplicate rows. The dataset contains information about property sales in Nashville, including sale dates, addresses, sale prices, and legal references.

Each project includes SQL queries with comments explaining the purpose of each query and the steps involved in the analysis or data cleaning process. These projects demonstrate the use of SQL for data analysis and preprocessing tasks, providing valuable insights into real-world datasets.
